## Background
Alison is a career counselor who came to us needing a stronger brand identity and clear printable graphics for use in her counseling practice, Vocational Advantage.

## Objectives
**1.** Develop a trustworthy brand that will stand the test of time

**2.** Update her digital presence to match the new brand

**3.** Develop a set of parsable and printable word templates for her use as a counselor

## Process

### Branding

**LOGOMARK + LOGOTYPE**: The loop logo evokes switching things up, starting new while the logotype uses Montserrat, a modern and clean font that connotes authority.

**DEEPER MEANING**: Loop arrows designed to represent V.A. for Vocational Advantage.

**COLOUR**: As it is a warm and radiant color, this faded amber is associated with energy. Its vibrance can promote feelings of happiness and inspire boldness. In color psychology, amber is thought to symbolize and promote vitality, confidence and safety.

### Website
We then integrated with Alison's current Squarespace website, implementing the new brand colours, logo and type.

### Templates
When a client hires Alison, she follows a repeatable process to help guide them towards well-fitting careers. We were tasked with creating two professional template documents that would save her time and help her focus on quality guidance. The first allowed Alison to document the personality exploration process with the client and the second was a final report template that would provide the client with a comprehensive summary of the career counseling.

## Results
With a new brand, set of re-usable templates, and updated website, Vocational Advantage was in a great place to highlight and augment Alison's strengths as a councilor.
