## Background
John is a visual artist, fashion designer, and founder of the streetwear brand ACiD. 

## Discovery
John approached us with a desire to overhaul the ACiD e-commerce website.  Our initial meetings revealed that he wanted the experience to be more in-line with other streetwear brands.  A survey of key precedents led us to prioritize speed, simplicity, and clear navigation.

The original website’s shopping & checkout flow was slow & difficult to navigate for users. The inconsistent design elements made it hard to use, especially on mobile.  All this for a monthly operational cost that was hurting John’s bottom line.

## Objectives
1. Allow the products to shine with clear navigation and information hierarchy
2. Create a standardize shopping and checkout experience that minimize user cognitive load
3. Reduce monthly operating costs and move to a more flexible platform

## Process
ACiD’s products have a very strong identity, so we developed a design system of typography and UI that would accent this.  We opted for clean stencil (name of font) and sans serif (name of font) fonts to appear modern while staying true to John’s streetwear aesthetic.

Clear navigation hierarchy reduces the number of clicks users need to make to hop between pages. Using a flexible grid system means the website functions flawlessly on both mobile and desktop.

By switching from WIX eCommerce to a custom JAMstack solution using Snipcart allowed for a lightweight back-end with complete flexibility in designing the front-end. This resulted in a faster, and more user friendly website at 20% of the operating cost.

## Results
Armed with modern and flexible e-commerce solution, John has been able to focus on the creativity behind his pieces, while his customers flock to the new website.
