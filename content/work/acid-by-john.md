## Background
John is a visual artist, fashion designer, and founder of the streetwear brand ACiD. He came to us to create a new e-commerce experience for his seeking to eliminate user experience pain-points on both the front- and back-ends of ACiD’s.

## Objectives
ACiD is a brand that speaks for itself. The primary objective of the web experience is to make the brand shine. The original website’s shopping & checkout experience was slow & difficult to navigate for users. The inconsistent design elements made it hard to use, especially on mobile. And all this for a monthly operational cost that was nonsensically high.

Our initial meetings with John revealed that he wanted the web experience to be in line with other streetwear brands his target audience might frequent. A survey of key precedents led us to prioritize speed, simplicity, and consistency.

## Process
ACiD already had a strong brand identity, so we worked on a design system of typography and UI that complimented it. This presents a challenge distinct from creating a brand from scratch, but ensuring that UI elements are modular and anchored to ACiD’s visual language ensured appropriate font choice and stronger webpage layouts.

The simplicity and directness of the brand carried forward into designing the user experience. A clearer sense of hierarchy within pages afforded the same between pages. The two-tiered navigation reduces the number of clicks users need to make to hop between pages. And using a flexible grid system means the website functions flawlessly on both mobile and desktop.
